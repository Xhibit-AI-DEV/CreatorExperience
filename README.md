# CreatorExperience
Xhibit is a live mobile app for immersive AI style discovery that enables creators to publish lookbooks and styling agents which allow users to remix and engage with curated collections. As part of the Creator Experience, Xhibit will extend its platform with blockchain-powered features to support creator payments, intellectual property (IP) tracking, and token-based rewards.
